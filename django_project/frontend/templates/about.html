    </div>

    Healthsites is a framework for capturing, publishing and sharing critical
    health and sanitation related data to help make these facilities more
    accessible and relevant to the communities they serve. Our framework does
    not limit our endeavours to these domains and in the future we plan to
    support additional domains where it is helpful in humanitarian work.
